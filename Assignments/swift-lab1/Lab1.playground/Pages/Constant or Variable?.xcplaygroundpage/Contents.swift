 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let name = "Nolan"
print("Your legal name or whatever name you go by when signing up for the app is very unlikely to change throughout the duration of your time using the app.")
var age = 22
print("Every year on your birthday, your age changes!")
var steps = 4032
print("The amount of steps you take each day will vary as we never have two days which are exactly the same.")
var stepGoal = 3400
print("The amount of steps you strive for can change as you improve or regress your amount of activity.")
var heartRate = 97
print("Your heart rate changes every second depending on the amount of oxygen your body requires during both sedentary and intensive activities.")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
