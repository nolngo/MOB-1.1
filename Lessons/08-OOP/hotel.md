# Managing a hotel

Your are going to model a hotel managing system.

For every hotel we track the address and number of rooms.

More details about the rooms: they are all numbered and there are 4 different types of rooms: single, double, triple and quad. All ranging from 10 dlls to 40 dlls per night.

Every hotel has a manager who gets paid per hour. We also need to know their name.

There are also guests, who book rooms. Guests can have or not, a pet. We need to know if the guest is bringing a pet. Since there is a fee of 25 dlls per stay.

To register a booking we need to know who is booking the room, for how many days, and give them the final price.
