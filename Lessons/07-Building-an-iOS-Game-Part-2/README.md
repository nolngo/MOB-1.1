Your complete project should meet the following requirements:

- Bubbles at random x-positions that move all the way up the screen.
- Bubbles should be removed if they reach the top or if a user taps on them.
- Use a texture on the bubbles or any other place in the game.
- Keeping score: tapped bubbles add 1 point, bubbles that reach the top decrease score by one.
- Showing & updating the score with a label.
- If the score is less than zero the game ends.
- Showing a message at the end.
- Restarting the game. (Stretch challenge)
